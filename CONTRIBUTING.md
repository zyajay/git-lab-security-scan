## Issue tracker

To get support for your particular problem please use the
[getting help channels](https://about.gitlab.com/getting-help/).

The [GitLab EE issue tracker on GitLab.com][ee-tracker] is the right place for bugs and feature proposals about Security Products. 
Please use the ~"Security Products" label when opening a new issue to ensure it is quickly reviewed by the right people.

**[Search the issue tracker][ee-tracker]** for similar entries before
submitting your own, there's a good chance somebody else had the same issue or
feature proposal. Show your support with an award emoji and/or join the
discussion. 

Not all issues will be addressed and your issue is more likely to
be addressed if you submit a merge request which partially or fully solves
the issue. If it happens that you know the solution to an existing bug, please first
open the issue in order to keep track of it and then open the relevant merge
request that potentially fixes it.
